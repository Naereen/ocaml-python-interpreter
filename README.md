# OCaml Python Interpreter

By Xnoe.

This was this starting point of a very simple Python interpreter I wrote while learning OCaml. Originally my goal was to get it to a point where I could run calc.py inside it.

Sadly, as the code grew larger, it became more and more unmanagable. It works... somewhat. Every python file except calc.py can run. Calc.py just ends up in an infinite loop at some stage.

This is a mostly failed project and I probably won't ever update it again.

Treat the codebase as being under cc0.
