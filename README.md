# OCaml Python Interpreter

By Xnoe.

Ultra-basic starting point of a python interpreter. CC0.

Supoorts a variety of features, enough to run each example you can see listed alongside it in the git repo.

This was a project I made mostly for fun.

Do note: The way I handled indentation is awful, and this was the first OCaml project I did, so... it's probably not very good :P
